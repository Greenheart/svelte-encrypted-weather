# Svelte Encrypted SPA

üîê Easily create private, encrypted single page applications with Svelte and PageCrypt.

## Technologies used

-   `svelte` for rapid UI development.
-   `vite` for modern DX and bundling.
-   `tailwindcss` with `jit` mode for simple and efficient styling.
-   `svelte-pathfinder` for in-memory routing.
-   `vite-plugin-singlefile` for building a single output HTML file that can be easily encrypted along with all its assets.
-   `pagecrypt` for encrypting the output HTML with strong encryption a password.
-   `prettier` for consistent code formatting.

## Installation

```
npx degit Greenheart/svelte-encrypted-weather svelte-encrypted-weather  # Download repo without git history
cd svelte-encrypted-weather
npm install
```

**Important:** This project requires an Open Weather Map API key to work. It takes 2 min to sign up and get a key from your settings on https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

Then update the secret in `.env.example` and save the file as `.env` to make sure it loads in the app.

And now you're ready to start the app locally!

```
npm start
```

## Change the password for the built app

In `package.json`, update the `encrypt` npm script and use any of the options from [pagecrypt](https://github.com/Greenheart/pagecrypt) to either generate or set a password.

## Static assets in the `/public` directory

By default, the static assets in the `/public` directory will not be encrypted, so make sure to find a good solution for your use case.

One approach is to host static assets separately on another server. This will hide both the assets thelselves, and the URL:s from where the app will fetch them since the source code is encrypted.

## Scripts

### Start a development server

`npm start`
